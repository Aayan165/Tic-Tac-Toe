# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a C++ Tic Tac Toe game where the player ('X') competes against the computer ('O') on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal. The computer uses strategy to win or block the player. The game ends when a player wins or the grid is full, resulting in a tie if no one wins.
